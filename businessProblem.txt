**Business Problem**
We run a mid-sized software development company, managing multiple projects across different teams. Our business involves overseeing development teams, tracking progress, ensuring code quality, and meeting client deadlines. We need an internal ERP system to help manage and optimize the following:

#1. Development Team and Project Management  
   - **Team Profiles**  
      - Each team has a detailed profile containing all relevant information for task management, workload distribution, and productivity tracking.
      - **Details included in Team Profiles**:
         - **Team Overview**:
            - Team Name: A unique identifier for each team (e.g., "Frontend Wizards", "Backend Gurus").
            - Team Type: Categorize teams based on their function (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Full-Stack, QA).
            - Department: Associate teams with departments (e.g., Web Development, Mobile Development, DevOps).
         - **Team Members**:
            - **Basic Information**: Full name, contact details (email, phone), and role in the team (e.g., Full-Stack Developer, QA Lead).
            - **Skillset**: A detailed list of programming languages, frameworks, and technologies each team member is proficient in. This should be filterable for project assignments.
            - **Experience**: Years of experience with specific technologies, past projects worked on, and performance feedback from past projects.
            - **Workload**: Track individual workloads based on current tasks, estimated task completion time, and overall team balance. Visualize this using a progress bar for each member.
         - **Current Projects**: A real-time list of active projects assigned to the team, including project deadlines, status, and task breakdown.
         - **Capacity Tracking**:
            - Show how much work each team can handle, with a visual heatmap indicating overworked (red) or underutilized (green) teams.
            - Provide forecasts for upcoming availability based on ongoing tasks and upcoming holidays or time off.
         - **Time-Off and Availability**:
            - Manage scheduled leave (e.g., vacations, personal days) and mark unavailable team members.
            - Show this availability in project planning to avoid assigning critical tasks to unavailable team members.
         - **Productivity Metrics**:
            - Track key performance indicators like lines of code (LOC) written, pull requests (PRs) submitted and reviewed, and bugs fixed.
            - Generate monthly, quarterly, and yearly performance summaries for individual team members and teams.

   - **Project Tracking and Progress Monitoring**  
      - This section enables detailed tracking of each project's lifecycle, ensuring smooth development across planning, coding, testing, and deployment stages.
      - **Project Overview**:
         - **Basic Info**: Project name, start date, estimated completion date, project manager, and description.
         - **Phases**: Break projects into clear phases (e.g., Planning, Development, QA Testing, Deployment), with visual timelines showing milestones, dependencies, and key deadlines.
         - **Milestones and Deliverables**:
            - Set important milestones (e.g., Alpha release, Beta release) and attach critical deliverables to each milestone (e.g., features or modules to be delivered).
         - **Project Dependencies**:
            - Visualize dependencies between tasks, phases, or projects (e.g., "Task A must be completed before Task B can begin") with Gantt charts or dependency graphs.
         - **Task Breakdown**:
            - Create and assign specific tasks and subtasks to team members.
            - **Task Details**:
               - Description: Brief overview of the task.
               - Priority: Indicate whether it is critical, high, medium, or low priority.
               - Status: Track the status of the task (e.g., Pending, In Progress, In Review, Completed).
               - Assignee: Assign team members or groups to the task, along with any dependencies.
               - Estimated Hours and Due Date: Allow input for estimated completion time and assign due dates.
               - Progress Tracking: Use a progress bar or percentage completion for real-time status updates.
         - **Code Repositories**:
            - Integrate with GitHub/GitLab to link code repositories for each project, enabling the tracking of commits, PRs, and CI/CD pipeline statuses.
            - Enable users to click on a task to open the related repository or PR directly.
         - **Code Quality and Testing Metrics**:
            - **Unit Test Coverage**: Show what percentage of the codebase is covered by unit tests, with a target threshold (e.g., 90% coverage).
            - **Automated Testing Results**: Track results from automated tests in CI/CD pipelines and flag issues if tests fail.
            - **Code Reviews**: Track code review submissions, assign reviewers, and visualize the approval process.
         - **Feedback and Reviews**:
            - Maintain a feedback loop for projects, enabling team leads to review progress and client feedback. This includes client surveys, peer reviews, and internal quality assurance checks.

   - **Team Collaboration and Communication**  
      - Facilitates smooth communication and real-time collaboration among development teams and across departments.
      - **Collaboration Features**:
         - **Internal Messaging**:
