# Business Problem

We are **Y Combinator (YC)**, a renowned accelerator that supports and funds hundreds of early-stage startups across a diverse range of industries. Our operations involve managing the relationships between startups, investors, and mentors, tracking the progress of our portfolio companies, and ensuring proper support is provided throughout the development lifecycle. We need an internal ERP system to streamline our operations, improve tracking, and optimize our workflows.
