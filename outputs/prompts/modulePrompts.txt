You are a seasoned software architect. Your task is to design the pages within a module, ensuring they deliver **intuitive user experiences**, **modular 
consistency**, and **robust component design**. Each page should be structured with a clear **parent-child component hierarchy**. 

### Objectives:
- **Modular Consistency:** Align all pages with the module’s overall purpose and aesthetic. Ensure components are reusable, adaptable, and consistent across the module.
- **Component-Centric Design:** Focus on defining parent and child components, ensuring they work together seamlessly to create an intuitive user experience.
- **User-Centric Approach:** Design components with user navigation, interaction, and feedback in mind.

          - Generate reports on task completion times and efficiencies.
          - Visualize sprint progress and completion metrics.
        - **Secondary Tasks**: 
          - Facilitate peer review processes and document feedback.
          - Provide historical data to compare performance over time.
          - Track time spent on tasks using manual input or integrations.
        - **Key Features**: 
          - Performance Dashboards: Visual representations of productivity metrics.
          - Time Tracking Tools: Interfaces for logging hours worked on specific tasks.
          - Report Generation: Automated reports summarizing performance over selected periods.

      - **Frontend Logic:**
        - **User Interactions**: Users can view dashboards, input time logs, and generate reports with easy navigation through tabs and filters.
        - **Data Handling**: Example dummy data:
          ```
          Performance: [
            {member: "Alice", tasksCompleted: 15, averageCompletionTime: "2 hrs", peerReviews: {submitted: 5, approved: 4}},
            {member: "Bob", tasksCompleted: 10, averageCompletionTime: "3 hrs", peerReviews: {submitted: 3, approved: 2}}
          ]
          ```
          Validation checks to ensure valid time inputs.
        - **Dynamic Behaviors**: Dashboards refresh real-time as new performance data is logged, and user feedback is incorporated into analytics.

   3. **Interconnectivity:**
      - **Interactions**: This module exchanges performance data with the Development Team and Project Management module to provide context for team productivity and workload.
      - **Data Exchange**: Task completion metrics from the Project Tracking and Progress Monitoring module inform performance reports and dashboards.
      - **Integration Points**: Utilizes shared UI components for visualizing data trends and notifications related to performance updates.

   4. **Additional Notes:**
        - **Strict Module Adherence**: The module strictly adheres to the specified functionality without adding extras.
        - **Component Grouping**: Consolidates all performance analytics features under one module.
        - **Frontend Focus**: Only frontend interactions are emphasized, with no backend logic.

   5. **Page Breakdown:**
      - **Performance Dashboard Page**: Overview of team and individual performance metrics, including graphs and KPIs.
      - **Time Tracking Page**: Interface for logging hours worked and categorizing tasks.
      - **Sprint Analysis Page**: Detailed analytics on sprint performance, including burndown charts and completion rates.
      - **Peer Review Page**: Summarizes feedback from peer reviews and tracks approval rates.
