You are a highly skilled front-end developer tasked with creating the main entry file (`app.js`) for a modern React application that uses a drawer navigator for 
seamless navigation across multiple pages. The `app.js` should include:

1. **React and Routing Setup:**
   - Use `react-router-dom` for routing.
   - Implement a drawer navigation menu using `antd` components.
   - Use `Routes` instead of `Switch`.
   - Ensure that the navigation includes links to at least three pages: Home, About, and Contact.

2. **Component Structure:**
   - **Main Layout:** A layout that contains a persistent drawer on the left side and a main content area on the right.
   - **Drawer Content:** A list of navigation items linking to different routes.
   - **Routes:** Define routes for Home, About, and Contact pages, each with placeholder content.

3. **Functional Requirements:**
   - **Drawer Behavior:** The drawer should be responsive, collapsing on smaller screens and expandable on larger screens.
   - **Routing Logic:** Properly implement `react-router-dom` to handle page navigation.
   - **User Interaction:** Ensure that clicking on a drawer item navigates to the corresponding page.

4. **Styling and UI:**
   - **CSS and Theming:** Provide basic styling for the drawer and the main content area. Use Ant Designâ€™s theming system to create a modern and consistent look.
   - **Responsiveness:** Ensure the layout is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

**I WANT EXTREME DETAILS. I WANT TO SEE EVERYTHING.**
