### Page Name: Purchase Orders Page

#### 1. **Name and Purpose**
   - **Name:** Purchase Orders Page
   - **Purpose:** This page serves as the central interface for managing purchase orders, allowing users to create new orders, view existing ones, and export order information.
   - **Problems Solved:** 
     - Simplifies the process of creating and managing purchase orders.
     - Provides a clear overview of current purchase orders and their statuses.
     - Enables easy export of purchase order data for financial tracking.

#### 2. **Component Structure**
   - **Parent Components:**
     - **PurchaseOrderContainer:** 
       - **Core Role:** Acts as the main wrapper for the page, managing state and rendering child components.
       - **Components:** 
         - PurchaseOrderForm
         - PurchaseOrderTable
         - ExportButton
   - **Sub-Components (Children):**
     - **PurchaseOrderForm:**
       - **Functionality:** Form for entering new purchase orders including fields for supplier, item, quantity, and price.
     - **PurchaseOrderTable:**
       - **Functionality:** Displays a summary table of all purchase orders with options to edit or delete.
     - **ExportButton:**
       - **Functionality:** Triggers the export of purchase order data in CSV format.

   - **Component Breakdown:**
     - **Hierarchy:** 
       - PurchaseOrderContainer
         - PurchaseOrderForm
         - PurchaseOrderTable
         - ExportButton
     - **Dynamic Relationships:** 
       - PurchaseOrderTable updates in real-time as orders are added or modified via PurchaseOrderForm.
     - **Reusability:** 
       - PurchaseOrderForm can be reused on different pages that require order entry functionality.

#### 3. **User Interaction and Flow**
   - **Component Interactions:** 
     - Users fill out PurchaseOrderForm to create new orders, triggering state updates in PurchaseOrderContainer.
     - Users can click options in PurchaseOrderTable to edit or delete orders.
   - **Feedback Mechanisms:** 
     - Real-time validation feedback in PurchaseOrderForm (e.g., error messages for invalid quantity).
     - Confirmation prompts before deletion in PurchaseOrderTable.
   - **Adaptive Behavior:** 
     - The layout adjusts based on screen size, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### 4. **Data Handling**
   - **Data Flow:** 
     - Data flows from PurchaseOrderForm to PurchaseOrderContainer where it updates the state, which is then passed down to PurchaseOrderTable for rendering.
     - Mock data example: `{ id: 1, supplier: 'ABC Supplies', item: 'Glass', quantity: 100, price: 2000 }`
   - **State Management:** 
     - State is managed in PurchaseOrderContainer using React's useState hook to keep track of purchase orders.
   - **Mock Data Implementation:** 
     - Mock data can be created using JSON and stored in a local state for demonstration, simulating backend interactions.

#### 5. **Interconnectivity**
   - **Intra-Module Interactions:** 
     - PurchaseOrderTable may interact with the Statistics module to display purchasing trends.
   - **Data Sharing:** 
     - Purchase order data is shared between the Purchase Orders Page and other pages like the Dashboard.
   - **Integration Points:** 
     - Shared components like the form and table are used across different pages in the module for consistency.

#### 6. **Scalability and Performance**
   - **Scalability Considerations:** 
     - The component structure allows for easy addition of more input fields in PurchaseOrderForm or additional features in the table.
   - **Performance Metrics:** 
     - Metrics such as load times and interaction response times will be monitored using performance profiling tools.

#### 7. **Navigation and User Flow**
   - **Navigation To This Page:** 
     - Users can navigate to the Purchase Orders Page via a sidebar link labeled "Purchase Orders."
   - **Navigation From This Page:** 
     - Users can return to the main dashboard from this page using a "Back to Dashboard" button located at the top of the page.

#### 8. **Innovative Features**
   - **Unique Features:** 
     - Real-time data validation in the purchase order form enhances user experience.
   - **Components Needed for Innovative Features:** 
     - Use of Ant Design's Form.Item for validation feedback, and modal components for confirmation dialogs.

#### 9. **Page URL**
   - **URL for This Page (React):** `/purchase-orders`
